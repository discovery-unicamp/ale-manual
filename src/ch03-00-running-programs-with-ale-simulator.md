# Running Programs with the ALE Simulator

Running a program written in RISC-V assembly language requires either RISC-V hardware or a simulator.
Since our computers do not have RISC-V processors, we will use the RISC-V ALE simulator to run programs compiled for RISC-V.

The RISC-V ALE simulator will run in your web browser (e.g., Chrome or Firefox). To do this, simply visit the page https://riscv-programming.org/ale/.
Figure 3.0.1 illustrates the initial interface of the simulator.
